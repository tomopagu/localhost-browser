# Localhost Browser

This is a webpage that lists all the folders within your htdocs/www folder adding Search support to make it easier to filter down to find a specific folder.

Pretty basic at the moment, `index.php` has a config for you to specify the base folder & ignored folders. Move `moveme.index.php` to the route of your localhost folder and rename it to `index.php`. If the folder you clone this into isn't called `sites` then you'll need to change the path on line 5 of `site.js` to the folder containing `index.php`

I'll make it look prettier and easier to understand some point soon.
